# Machine-Learning---Deep-Learning

Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for object detection and classification.
Group Project for IU CSCI P556 Applied Machine Learning by Courtney Payton, Kelly Craig, Martin Berth, and Vicente De Leon.

Phase 1 and Phase 2 consist of EDA (exploratory data analysis), data processing/feature engineering, pipelines creation, Classification and Regression algorithms using Scikit-learn. Phase 3 and Phase 4 consist of Deep Learning Neural Networks like Multilayer Perceptron models along with techniques other techniques such as Transfer Learning. 

Google Colab was used for all phases, including custom VMs from Google Cloud.
PyTorch was the machine learning framework implemented for Phase 3.
