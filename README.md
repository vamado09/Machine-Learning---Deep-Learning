# Machine-Learning---Deep-Learning Object Detection and Classification

Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for Cats and Dogs image detection (regression) and classification.
Group Project for Indiana University Bloomington CSCI P556 Applied Machine Learning by Courtney Payton, Kelly Craig, Martin Berth, and Vicente De Leon.

The project spanned four distinct phases, each strategically designed to achieve specific goals. Phases 1 and 2 involved Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data processing, and feature engineering, followed by the implementation of classification and regression algorithms using Scikit-learn. Phases 3 and 4 introduced the realm of Deep Learning, encompassing models such as Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Fully Convolutional Networks. Additionally, advanced techniques like Transfer Learning, employing the renowned AlexNet architecture, were explored. In Phases 3 and 4, PyTorch and TensorFlow(Keras API) took center stage, providing the tools necessary to tackle regression and classification tasks. The integration of TensorBoard further facilitated model training and optimization. Experimentations were conducted on Google Colab. Additionally, the support of custom virtual machines from Google Cloud provided a robust infrastructure.
